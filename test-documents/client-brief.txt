PROJECT: Brand Refresh & E-commerce Launch

SUBMITTED BY: Sarah Chen, Marketing Director

COMPANY BACKGROUND
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GreenLeaf Organics is a family-owned organic food producer based in Portland, Oregon. Founded in 2015, we've grown from a small farmers market vendor to a regional supplier of organic snacks, granola, and health foods available in 200+ retail locations across the Pacific Northwest.

We're at an inflection point: our products are gaining traction, but our brand identity and digital presence don't reflect our growth or ambitions. We need to modernize while maintaining our authentic, earth-friendly values.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PRIMARY GOAL:
Launch a direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform to complement our retail presence and test new products directly with our most engaged customers.

SECONDARY GOALS:
- Refresh brand identity to appeal to younger, health-conscious consumers (25-40)
- Establish consistent brand guidelines for packaging and marketing
- Create a scalable digital marketing foundation
- Build customer database for future marketing initiatives

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TARGET AUDIENCE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PRIMARY AUDIENCE: "Conscious Consumers"
- Age: 28-42
- Income: $60K-$120K household
- Values: Sustainability, health, transparency, local businesses
- Behavior: Regular Whole Foods/natural grocery shoppers, active on Instagram, subscribe to wellness newsletters
- Pain points: Difficulty finding truly organic products, skeptical of greenwashing, want convenience without compromising values

SECONDARY AUDIENCE: "Wellness Parents"
- Age: 30-45
- Income: $75K-$150K household
- Values: Family health, clean ingredients, teaching kids good habits
- Behavior: Meal prep focused, read ingredient labels carefully, involved in school/community
- Pain points: Time constraints, kid-friendly healthy options limited, want trustworthy brands

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BRAND PERCEPTION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CURRENT STATE:
- Viewed as authentic and trustworthy by existing customers
- Packaging feels "homemade" (good and bad - authentic but unprofessional)
- Strong local reputation but unknown outside Pacific Northwest
- Social media presence is inconsistent and amateur

DESIRED STATE:
- Professional yet approachable
- Premium quality without being pretentious
- Modern but not trendy
- Transparent and educational
- Instagram-worthy while maintaining substance

BRAND ATTRIBUTES (in priority order):
1. Authentic
2. Sustainable
3. High-quality
4. Approachable
5. Transparent

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DIRECT COMPETITORS:
- NutraBar Organics (larger, national, but feels corporate)
- Portland Provisions (similar values, better design, higher prices)
- Nature's Path (established, but less authentic feeling)

ASPIRATIONAL BRANDS:
- Hu Kitchen (premium positioning, great storytelling)
- Simple Mills (clean design, clear messaging)
- Miyoko's Creamery (transparency, strong founder story)

DIFFERENTIATION:
- True small-batch production (not faking small for marketing)
- Direct relationships with local farmers
- Transparent supply chain - we can name every supplier
- Active in community - farmer's markets, local events
- Family story and values drive decisions, not just profit
