Terms and Conditions
This estimate is governed by the terms and conditions set forth within the Agency Agreement signed by the client. By signing this estimate, the client agrees to those terms and the terms set forth within this document and agrees to pay for services rendered.
If completion of the Company’s obligations under these Terms is prevented or delayed by any act or omission of the Client or its agents, subcontractors, consultants, or employees, Netwave shall not be deemed in breach of its obligations under these Terms or otherwise liable for any costs, charges or losses sustained or incurred by Client.  In each case where the Client delay exceeds 30 days during any phase of the project, the project will be removed from our production schedule and all costs incurred to date will be invoiced to the client at that time, payable upon receipt.  Subsequently, upon continuation of the project, the project will be re-estimated based on the remaining work to be completed. Upon approval, the project shall be placed into our production schedule where it fits at the time. 

Cancellations, Weather, Postponements 
Standard Cancellations
	•	If the Client cancels at any time after the contract is awarded, the 50% deposit will be forfeited.
	•	If the video shoot is rescheduled for a later date with more than 5 business days' notice, the deposit payment will not be forfeited.
	•	If the non-weather related cancellation or rescheduling occurs within 5 business days of the scheduled shoot day, 100% of the total job, less editing cost is due. Payment of the cancellation fees and deposit for the new shoot date must be paid to reschedule the shoot.

Weather-Related Postponements for Outdoor Shoots
Each outdoor shoot will have a pre-scheduled rain date. If the shoot is postponed due to weather:
	•	More than 72 hours before the confirmed shoot date: 
	•	No penalty will apply. 
	•	The shoot will move to the pre-scheduled rain date. 
	•	A new rain date will be mutually agreed upon. 
	•	The deposit carries over to the new shoot date.
	•	48 to 72 hours before the shoot day:
	•	The 50% deposit will be forfeited. 
	•	The shoot will move to the rain date, and a new rain date will be scheduled. 
	•	A new deposit will be required before the new shoot date.
	•	Less than 48 hours before the shoot day: 
	•	A cancellation fee of 100% of the job cost, less editing, will apply.
	•	The deposit will be forfeited, and a new invoice for the remaining cancellation fees will be sent and must be paid before the new shoot is scheduled.
	•	The shoot will move to the rain date, and a new rain date will be scheduled. 
	•	Payment of the cancellation fee for the cancelled shoot and a 50% deposit for the rescheduled shoot is required to restart production. 
If the shoot is not rescheduled and simply cancelled, the deposit will still be forfeited, and the cancellation fee still applies.
In cases of extreme weather where it would be difficult, impossible, or unsafe for either party to attend the shoot, the shoot will be rescheduled and the deposit will be applied to the new shoot date with no cancellation fee. If the crew is on set and an extreme weather event happens, 100% cancellation fee less editing applies.
