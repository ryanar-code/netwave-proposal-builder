Next Steps & Payment Terms
This estimate will be honored for 30 days from the date above. Price accurate to +/- 10% the price quoted here is only for the work described within this estimate. A 50% deposit is required to commence work. Remaining balance due upon final delivery.
Once the estimate is approved, Netwave will submit a digital copy of the proposal, our Agency Agreement, and a deposit invoice for payment. Upon signature and receipt of payment, the project will commence. If any new requests for development and/or design, new specs, new documents or anything that Netwave hasn’t already seen is brought up after the project has already started, additional costs can be added to the remaining invoices or can be handled in another phase of the project.

Terms and Conditions
This estimate is governed by the terms and conditions set forth within the Agency Agreement signed by the client. By signing this estimate, the client agrees to those terms and the terms set forth within this document and agrees to pay for services rendered.
If completion of the Company’s obligations under these Terms is prevented or delayed by any act or omission of the Client or its agents, subcontractors, consultants, or employees, Netwave shall not be deemed in breach of its obligations under these Terms or otherwise liable for any costs, charges or losses sustained or incurred by Client.  In each case where the Client delay exceeds 30 days during any phase of the project, the project will be removed from our production schedule and all costs incurred to date will be invoiced to the client at that time, payable upon receipt.  Subsequently, upon continuation of the project, the project will be re-estimated based on the remaining work to be completed. Upon approval, the project shall be placed into our production schedule where it fits at the time. 

Cancellations, Weather, Postponements 
Standard Cancellations
	•	If the Client cancels at any time after the contract is awarded, the 50% deposit will be forfeited.
	•	If the shoot is rescheduled for a later date with more than 5 business days' notice, the deposit payment will not be forfeited.

Weather-Related Postponements for Outdoor Shoots
Each outdoor shoot will have a pre-scheduled rain date. If the shoot is postponed due to weather:
	•	More than 72 hours before the confirmed shoot date: 
	•	No penalty will apply. 
	•	The shoot will move to the pre-scheduled rain date. 
	•	A new rain date will be mutually agreed upon. 
	•	The deposit carries over to the new shoot date.
	•	Less than 48 hours before the shoot day: 
	•	The deposit will be forfeited
	•	The shoot will move to the rain date, and a new rain date will be scheduled. 
	•	A new 50% deposit for the rescheduled shoot is required to restart production. 
If the shoot is not rescheduled and simply cancelled, the deposit will still be forfeited..
In cases of extreme weather where it would be difficult, impossible, or unsafe for either party to attend the shoot, the shoot will be rescheduled and the deposit will be applied to the new shoot date with no cancellation fee.
