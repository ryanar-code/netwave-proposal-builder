Executive Summary
To keep your website secure and running smoothly at all times, Netwave recommends providing quarterly maintenance on the newly launched website. As technology continues to improve, new WordPress framework and plugin versions will be released.
Netwave will run a full website scan to check for any website errors or vulnerabilities that should be addressed/resolved. Upon completion, Netwave will review the scan report and determine if the framework and/or plugins need to be updated. If so, Netwave will proceed with applying the updates to the website saved on our staging (test) server to ensure there is not an interruption on the live website.
If there are extensive changes that need to be resolved, Netwave will provide a formal estimate prior to proceeding with the suggested changes.

Scope of Work

Quarterly Website Maintenance

By continually updating the WordPress framework and associated plugins, your website will be safe and secure from internet threats. The following is the process Netwave will follow to ensure website safety.

Backup Website
Netwave will download the latest version of the live website on our local server, replacing the previously saved version.





Website Scan
Once a copy of the website has been saved on Netwave’s servers, we will initiate a full website scan. Netwave scans the website version that is saved on our server to ensure that the testing does not slow down the live website. The scan will provide an extensive error report listing outdated website plugins, vulnerabilities, and threats that should be addressed to help improve website performance since the previous scan. Sometimes there are numerous updates needed; other times, no changes are needed

Resolve Error Log
Upon completion of the full website scan, Netwave will address and resolve each error. At this time, Netwave will also provide recommendations if certain plugins should be updated, replaced, or removed if not needed.
Recap Report
Upon the completion of the website scan, Netwave will provide a full recap report of the threats that were found, addressed and resolved. Should additional coding be required to improve the website’s efficiency or technology, Netwave will provide a separate proposal before proceeding.
